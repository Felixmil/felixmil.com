I am a software (R) developer at [esqLABS](https://esqlabs.com), working on the [Open Systems Pharmacology Suite R](https://www.open-systems-pharmacology.org) and internal packages.

I previously worked as a data scientist in Stago, a company that design, sell and distribute hemostasis analyzers and was in charge of supporting R&D efforts using data.
