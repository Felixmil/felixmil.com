::: {#hero-heading}
👋 Hi, I'm Felix.

👨‍💻 I'm a R developer working at [ESQlabs](ESQlabs.com) to support the [Open Systems Pharmacology](https://www.open-systems-pharmacology.org/) initiative and enable a more open source and ethical pharmaceutical and other life-sciences applications.

🔍 I'm interested in many topics, both in professional and personal life. Check out my [now page](/now.md) to see what I'm currently focused on.

📝 I occasionally share my thoughts and insights through [blog posts](/blog.md) on a variety of fascinating topics ranging from data science to personal interests.
